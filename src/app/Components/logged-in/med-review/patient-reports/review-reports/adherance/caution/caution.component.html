  <b class="large">Some words of caution for those using refill history to measure adherence:</b>&nbsp;
  <ul>
    <li>
      All of the patient’s fill records for the assessed drug or regimen are necessary. Otherwise, it may appear as
      though a patient is not consistently filling their prescriptions, and consequently, the MPR or PDC will be
      reduced.
    </li>
    <li>
      Entering the incorrect days’ supplied and other human errors can result in inaccurate results.
    </li>
    <li>
      The results can be overstated due to early dose titrations and patients refilling early. Conversely, for patients
      who are new to therapy, the fill date for the first dispensing can be much earlier than the actual first dose.
      This might occur because the patient is awaiting administration training from the doctor or tapering off of
      another medication, which can lead to a later-than-expected first refill and decrease the calculated MPR or PDC.
    </li>
  </ul>
